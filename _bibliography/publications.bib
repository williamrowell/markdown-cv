abstract = {Abstract Despite significant advancements in rare genetic disease diagnostics, many patients with rare genetic disease remain without a molecular diagnosis. Novel tools and methods are needed to improve the detection of disease-associated variants and understand the genetic basis of many rare diseases. Long-read genome sequencing provides improved sequencing in highly repetitive, homologous, and low-complexity regions, and improved assessment of structural variation and complex genomic rearrangements compared to short-read genome sequencing. As such, it is a promising method to explore overlooked genetic variants in rare diseases with a high suspicion of a genetic basis. We therefore applied PacBio HiFi sequencing in a large multi-generational family presenting with autosomal dominant 46,XY differences of sexual development (DSD), for whom extensive molecular testing over multiple decades had failed to identify a molecular diagnosis. This revealed a rare SINE-VNTR-Alu retroelement insertion in intron 4 of NR5A1, a gene in which loss-of-function variants are an established cause of 46,XY DSD. The insertion segregated among affected family members and was associated with loss-of-expression of alleles in cis, demonstrating a functional impact on NR5A1. This case highlights the power of long-read genome sequencing to detect genomic variants that have previously been intractable to detection by standard short-read genomic testing.}

    Circular consensus sequencing with Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) technology
    generates long (10--25{\thinspace}kilobases), accurate `HiFi' reads by
    combining serial observations of a DNA molecule into a consensus sequence.
    The standard approach to consensus generation, pbccs, uses a hidden Markov
    model. We introduce DeepConsensus, which uses an alignment-based loss to
    train a gap-aware transformer--encoder for sequence correction. Compared to
    pbccs, DeepConsensus reduces read errors by 42{\%}. This increases the
    yield of PacBio HiFi reads at Q20 by 9{\%}, at Q30 by 27{\%} and at Q40 by
    90{\%}. With two SMRT Cells of HG003, reads from DeepConsensus improve
    hifiasm assembly contiguity (NG50 4.9{\thinspace}megabases (Mb) to
    17.2{\thinspace}Mb), increase gene completeness (94{\%} to 97{\%}), reduce
    the false gene duplication rate (1.1{\%} to 0.5{\%}), improve assembly base
    accuracy (Q43 to Q45) and reduce variant-calling errors by 24{\%}.
    DeepConsensus models could be trained to the general problem of analyzing
    the alignment of other types of sequences, such as unique molecular
    identifiers or genome assemblies.

    Summary Genome in a Bottle benchmarks are widely used to help validate
    clinical sequencing pipelines and develop variant calling and sequencing
    methods. Here we use accurate linked and long reads to expand benchmarks in
    7 samples to include difficult-to-map regions and segmental duplications
    that are challenging for short reads. These benchmarks add more than
    300,000 SNVs and 50,000 insertions or deletions (indels) and include 16%
    more exonic variants, many in challenging, clinically relevant genes not
    covered previously, such as PMS2. For HG002, we include 92% of the
    autosomal GRCh38 assembly while excluding regions problematic for
    benchmarking small variants, such as copy number variants, that should not
    have been in the previous version, which included 85% of GRCh38. It
    identifies eight times more false negatives in a short read variant call
    set relative to our previous benchmark. We demonstrate that this benchmark
    reliably identifies false positives and false negatives across
    technologies, enabling ongoing methods development.

    Abstract Currently, protein-coding de novo variants and large copy number
    variants have been identified as important for ~30\% of individuals with
    autism. One approach to identify relevant variation in individuals who lack
    these types of events is by utilizing newer genomic technologies. In this
    study, highly accurate PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing was applied to a
    family with autism, epileptic encephalopathy, cognitive impairment, and
    mild dysmorphic features (two affected female siblings, unaffected parents,
    and one unaffected male sibling) with no known clinical variant. From our
    long-read sequencing data, a de novo missense variant in the KCNC2 gene
    (encodes Kv3.2) was identified in both affected children. This variant was
    phased to the paternal chromosome of origin and is likely a germline
    mosaic. In silico assessment revealed the variant was not in controls,
    highly conserved, and predicted damaging. This specific missense variant
    (Val473Ala) has been shown in both an ortholog and paralog of Kv3.2 to
    accelerate current decay, shift the voltage dependence of activation, and
    prevent the channel from entering a long-lasting open state. Seven
    additional missense variants have been identified in other individuals with
    neurodevelopmental disorders (p = 1.03 × 10−5). KCNC2 is most highly
    expressed in the brain; in particular, in the thalamus and is enriched in
    GABAergic neurons. Long-read sequencing was useful in discovering the
    relevant variant in this family with autism that had remained a mystery for
    several years and will potentially have great benefits in the clinic once
    it is widely available.

    The repetitive nature and complexity of some medically relevant genes poses
    a challenge for their accurate analysis in a clinical setting. The Genome
    in a Bottle Consortium has provided variant benchmark sets, but these
    exclude nearly 400 medically relevant genes due to their repetitiveness or
    polymorphic complexity. Here, we characterize 273 of these 395 challenging
    autosomal genes using a haplotype-resolved whole-genome assembly. This
    curated benchmark reports over 17,000 single-nucleotide variations, 3,600
    insertions and deletions and 200 structural variations each for human
    genome reference GRCh37 and GRCh38 across HG002. We show that false
    duplications in either GRCh37 or GRCh38 result in reference-specific,
    missed variants for short- and long-read technologies in medically relevant
    genes, including CBS, CRYAA and KCNE1. When masking these false
    duplications, variant recall can improve from 8{\%} to 100{\%}. Forming
    benchmarks from a haplotype-resolved whole-genome assembly may become a
    prototype for future benchmarks covering the whole genome.

    Objective We have used long-read single molecule, real-time (SMRT)
    sequencing to fully characterize a ~12Mb genomic region on chromosome
    Xq24-q27, significantly linked to bipolar disorder (BD) in an extended
    family from a genetic sub-isolate. This family segregates BD in at least
    four generations with 24 affected individuals.   Methods We selected 16
    family members for targeted sequencing. The selected individuals either
    carried the disease haplotype, were non-carriers of the disease haplotype,
    or served as married-in controls. We designed hybrid capture probes
    enriching for 5-9Kb fragments spanning the entire 12Mb region that were
    then sequenced to screen for candidate structural variants (SVs) that could
    explain the increased risk for BD in this extended family.   Results
    Altogether, 201 variants were detected in the critically linked region.
    Although most of these represented common variants, three variants emerged
    that showed near-perfect segregation among all BD type I affected
    individuals. Two of the SVs were identified in or near genes belonging to
    the RNA Binding Motif Protein, X-Linked (RBMX) gene family—a 330bp Alu
    (subfamily AluYa5) deletion in intron 3 of the RBMX2 gene and an intergenic
    27bp tandem repeat deletion between the RBMX and G protein-coupled receptor
    101 (GPR101) genes. The third SV was a 50bp tandem repeat insertion in
    intron 1 of the Coagulation Factor IX (F9) gene.   Conclusions Among the
    three genetically linked SVs, additional evidence supported the Alu element
    deletion in RBMX2 as the leading candidate for contributing directly to the
    disease development of BD type I in this extended family.

    The use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice is becoming standard of
    care. However, due to the complex genetic makeup of pharmacogenes, not all
    genetic variation is currently accounted for. Here, we show the utility of
    long-read sequencing to resolve complex pharmacogenes by analyzing a
    well-characterised sample. This data consists of long reads that were
    processed to resolve phased haploblocks. 73{\%} of pharmacogenes were fully
    covered in one phased haploblock, including 9/15 genes that are 100{\%}
    complex. Variant calling accuracy in the pharmacogenes was high, with
    99.8{\%} recall and 100{\%} precision for SNVs and 98.7{\%} precision and
    98.0{\%} recall for Indels. For the majority of gene-drug interactions in
    the DPWG and CPIC guidelines, the associated genes could be fully resolved
    (62{\%} and 63{\%} respectively). Together, these findings suggest that
    long-read sequencing data offers promising opportunities in elucidating
    complex pharmacogenes and haplotype phasing while maintaining accurate
    variant calling.

    Most human genomes are characterized by aligning individual reads to the
    reference genome, but accurate long reads and linked reads now enable us to
    construct accurate, phased de novo assemblies. We focus on a medically
    important, highly variable, 5 million base-pair (bp) region where diploid
    assembly is particularly useful - the Major Histocompatibility Complex
    (MHC). Here, we develop a human genome benchmark derived from a diploid
    assembly for the openly-consented Genome in a Bottle sample HG002. We
    assemble a single contig for each haplotype, align them to the reference,
    call phased small and structural variants, and define a small variant
    benchmark for the MHC, covering 94{\%} of the MHC and 22368 variants
    smaller than 50{\thinspace}bp, 49{\%} more variants than a mapping-based
    benchmark. This benchmark reliably identifies errors in mapping-based
    callsets, and enables performance assessment in regions with much denser,
    complex variation than regions covered by previous benchmarks.

    Structural variation (SV) is typically defined as variation within the
    human genome that exceeds 50 base pairs (bp). SV may be copy number neutral
    or it may involve duplications, deletions, and complex rearrangements.
    Recent studies have shown SV to be associated with many human diseases.
    However, studies of SV have been challenging due to technological
    constraints. With the advent of third generation (long-read) sequencing
    technology, exploration of longer stretches of DNA not easily examined
    previously has been made possible. In the present study, we utilized third
    generation (long-read) sequencing techniques to examine SV in the EGFR
    landscape of four haplotypes derived from two human samples. We analyzed
    the EGFR gene and its landscape (+/- 500,000 base pairs) using this
    approach and were able to identify a region of non-coding DNA with over 90%
    similarity to the most common activating EGFR mutation in non-small cell
    lung cancer. Based on previously published Alu-element genome instability
    algorithms, we propose a molecular mechanism to explain how this non-coding
    region of DNA may be interacting with and impacting the stability of the
    EGFR gene and potentially generating this cancer-driver gene. By these
    techniques, we were also able to identify previously hidden structural
    variation in the four haplotypes and in the human reference genome (hg38).
    We applied previously published algorithms to compare the relative
    stabilities of these five different EGFR gene landscape haplotypes to
    estimate their relative potentials to generate the EGFR exon 19, 15 bp
    canonical deletion. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to use
    the differences in genomic architecture between targeted cancer-linked
    phased haplotypes to estimate their relative potentials to form a common
    cancer-linked driver mutation.

    The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate
    short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of
    circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of
    single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly
    accurate (99.8{\%}) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length
    of 13.5{\thinspace}kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the
    well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and
    recall rates of at least 99.91{\%} for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs),
    95.98{\%} for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99{\%} for
    structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of
    short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We
    estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the `genome in
    a bottle' (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64{\%}) variants can be
    phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome
    assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome
    with a contig N50 of >15{\thinspace}megabases (Mb) and concordance of
    99.997{\%}, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long
    reads.

    Dysregulation of alpha-synuclein expression has been implicated in the
    pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, in particular Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
    and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Previous studies have shown that the
    alternatively spliced isoforms of the SNCA gene are differentially
    expressed in different parts of the brain for PD and DLB patients.
    Similarly, SNCA isoforms with skipped exons can have a functional impact on
    the protein domains. The large intronic region of the SNCA gene was also
    shown to harbor structural variants that affect transcriptional levels.
    Here, we apply the first study of using long read sequencing with targeted
    capture of both the gDNA and cDNA of the SNCA gene in brain tissues of PD,
    DLB, and control samples using the PacBio Sequel system. The targeted
    full-length cDNA (Iso-Seq) data confirmed complex usage of known
    alternative start sites and variable 3′ UTR lengths, as well as novel 5′
    starts and 3′ ends not previously described. The targeted gDNA data allowed
    phasing of up to 81% of the ~114 kb SNCA region, with the longest phased
    block exceeding 54 kb. We demonstrate that long gDNA and cDNA reads have
    the potential to reveal long-range information not previously accessible
    using traditional sequencing methods. This approach has a potential impact
    in studying disease risk genes such as SNCA, providing new insights into
    the genetic etiologies, including perturbations to the landscape the gene
    transcripts, of human complex diseases such as synucleinopathies.

    Animals discriminate stimuli, learn their predictive value and use this
    knowledge to modify their behavior. In \textit{Drosophila}, the mushroom
    body (MB) plays a key role in these processes. Sensory stimuli are sparsely
    represented by ∼2000 Kenyon cells, which converge onto 34 output neurons
    (MBONs) of 21 types. We studied the role of MBONs in several associative
    learning tasks and in sleep regulation, revealing the extent to which
    information flow is segregated into distinct channels and suggesting
    possible roles for the multi-layered MBON network. We also show that
    optogenetic activation of MBONs can, depending on cell type, induce
    repulsion or attraction in flies. The behavioral effects of MBON
    perturbation are combinatorial, suggesting that the MBON ensemble
    collectively represents valence. We propose that local, stimulus-specific
    dopaminergic modulation selectively alters the balance within the MBON
    network for those stimuli. Our results suggest that valence encoded by the
    MBON ensemble biases memory-based action selection.

abstract={Long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques have been very successful in identifying structural variants (SVs).

The introduction of PacBio HiFi sequencing makes LRS also suited for detecting small variation. Here we evaluate the ability of HiFi reads to detect de novo mutations (DNMs) of all types, which are technically challenging variant types and a major cause of sporadic, severe, early-onset disease.},

abstract={Long-read HiFi genome sequencing allows for accurate detection and direct phasing of single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants. Recent algorithmic development enables simultaneous detection of CpG methylation for analysis of regulatory element activity directly in HiFi reads. We present a comprehensive haplotype resolved 5-base HiFi genome sequencing dataset from a rare disease cohort of 276 samples in 152 families to identify rare ({\textasciitilde}0.5{\%}) hypermethylation events. We find that 80{\%} of these events are allele-specific and predicted to cause loss of regulatory element activity. We demonstrate heritability of extreme hypermethylation including rare cis variants associated with short ({\textasciitilde}200{\thinspace}bp) and large hypermethylation events (>1{\thinspace}kb), respectively. We identify repeat expansions in proximal promoters predicting allelic gene silencing via hypermethylation and demonstrate allelic transcriptional events downstream. On average 30--40 rare hypermethylation tiles overlap rare disease genes per patient, providing indications for variation prioritization including a previously undiagnosed pathogenic allele in DIP2B causing global developmental delay. We propose that use of HiFi genome sequencing in unsolved rare disease cases will allow detection of unconventional diseases alleles due to loss of regulatory element activity.},
