   ABSTRACT   = {Background The MAGERS (Metabolic and Genetic Explorations in Refractory Schizophrenia) is a pilot multimodal -omics and psychiatric genetic counselling project involving 50 individuals with deeply phenotyped, severe treatment-resistant schizophrenia (SCZ) or schizoaffective disorder (SZAD) (N=50) recruited from a tertiary inpatient adult refractory psychosis clinical and research unit serving the province of British Columbia. In our first 25 cases, 9 (36{\%}) had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) rare or novel DNA sequence or structural variant (SV) relevant to their psychosis and/or neurodevelopmental phenotype(s). Preliminary data from the second 25 MAGERS participants are presented. Methods The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), structured neurological and dysmorphology exams, three-generation pedigrees, and clinical chromosomal microarrays (Cytoscan HD) were performed at entry. Comprehensive review of records and investigations and multidisciplinary DSM-5 diagnostic rounds were performed. Long-read HiFi whole genome sequencing (WGS) on PacBio's Revio sequencer at ∼ 30X coverage and whole blood RNA-Seq on llumina's NovaSeq (150 BP paired-end, 100M individual reads) were completed. Rare DNA sequence variants identified by DeepVariant were functionally annotated, filtered, and prioritized by Exomiser (v14.0.0) using VCF files and HPO-encoded phenotypes. Shortlisted P/LP variants were manually curated with multiple bioinformatics databases and literature review. Short tandem repeat analysis was performed using Straglr and TRGT; SV analyses are pending. Results Mean admission and discharge PANSS scores were 73.3 (n=24, SD 10) and 68.4 (n=23, SD 9) respectively. Participants (20 males and 5 females) were aged 18 - 65 (median age 31.7). Comorbid diagnoses included Catatonia (n=8), Intellectual Disability (n=4), Developmental Delay (n=8), ADHD (n=6), Learning Disability (n=3), Autism (n=9), substance use disorder (n=3), and OCD (n=3). Chromosomal microarrays detected two SVs curated clinically as P/LP in 2 male participants with SZAD: one with DD/ID, ASD, OCD, and catatonia and an ∼ 477 kb 3p21 exonic deletion overlapping ULK4, and the other, with a 906 Kb 16p13.11 duplication and developmental speech and fine motor deficits. Exonic variants were preliminarily analyzed from 21/25 PacBio whole genomes. Exomiser and manual curation identified likely pathogenic sequence variants in 7/21 participants (∼ 33{\%}), one each with heterozygous missense variants in ASH1L, ZSWIM6, SYNE1, OCRL, and MBD5 (the latter also harbored the 16p13.11 duplication), and heterozygous truncating variants in SETD1A and CACNA1C. Additionally, Straglr and TRGT found a potentially pathogenic expansion in ATXN10 in another participant. ASH1L and SETD1A are particularly strong SCZ risk genes, with odds ratios of ∼ 20 for protein-truncating variants in the SCHEMA consortium's meta-analysis, while ULK4, ZSWIM6, MBD5, SYNE1, and ATXN10 have been SCZ- and/or SZAD-associated. Overall, 9/21 cases (43{\%}) have a rare SV or sequence variant plausibly related to their neuropsychiatric phenotype. Results from all 25 cases, including rare SVs missed by CMA and case illustrations will be presented. Discussion Cohorts with treatment-resistant psychosis are enriched in rare exonic sequence and structural variants conferring substantial risk of psychosis, which may pinpoint key pathogenetic mechanisms to inform emerging precision medicine strategies. Case illustrations will be provided.},
