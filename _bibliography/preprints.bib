		Long-read HiFi genome sequencing (GS) allows for accurate detection and
		direct phasing of single nucleotide variants (SNV), indels, and structural
		variants (SV). Recent algorithmic development enables simultaneous detection
		of CpG methylation (mCpG) for analysis of regulatory element (RE) activity
		directly in HiFi-GS. We generated a comprehensive haplotype-resolved HiFi-GS
		dataset from a rare disease cohort of 276 samples in 152 families to identify
		rare (\~{}0.5\%) hyper-mCpG events. We found that 81\% of these events are
		allele-specific and predicted to cause loss of RE (LRE). We demonstrated
		heritability of extreme hyper-mCpG including rare cis SNVs and SVs causing
		short (\~{}200bp) and large hyper-mCpG events (\&gt;1 kb), respectively. We
		identified novel repeat expansions in proximal promoters predicting allelic
		gene silencing via hyper-mCpG and demonstrated allelic transcriptional events
		downstream. On average 30-40 LREs overlapped rare disease genes per patient,
		providing indications for variation prioritization. LRE led to a previously
		undiagnosed pathogenic allele in DIP2B causing global developmental delay. We
		propose that use of HiFi-GS in unsolved rare disease cases will allow
		detection of unconventional diseases alleles due to LRE.Competing Interest

		Like many insect species, Drosophila melanogaster are capable of maintaining
		a stable flight trajectory for periods lasting up to several hours(1, 2).
		Because aerodynamic torque is roughly proportional to the fifth power of wing
		length(3), even small asymmetries in wing size require the maintenance of
		subtle bilateral differences in flapping motion to maintain a stable path.
		Flies can even fly straight after losing half of a wing, a feat they
		accomplish via very large, sustained kinematic changes to the both damaged
		and intact wings(4). Thus, the neural network responsible for stable flight
		must be capable of sustaining fine-scaled control over wing motion across a
		large dynamic range. In this paper, we describe an unusual type of descending
		neurons (DNg02) that project directly from visual output regions of the brain
		to the dorsal flight neuropil of the ventral nerve cord. Unlike most
		descending neurons, which exist as single bilateral pairs with unique
		morphology, there is a population of at least 15 DNg02 cell pairs with nearly
		identical shape. By optogenetically activating different numbers of DNg02
		cells, we demonstrate that these neurons regulate wingbeat amplitude over a
		wide dynamic range via a population code. Using 2-photon functional imaging,
		we show that DNg02 cells are responsive to visual motion during flight in a
		manner that would make them well suited to continuously regulate bilateral
		changes in wing kinematics. Collectively, we have identified a critical set
		of DNs that provide the sensitivity and dynamic range required for flight
		control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing
		interest.

		Dysregulation of alpha-synuclein expression has been implicated in the
		pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, in particular Parkinson{\textquoteright}s
		Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Previous studies have shown
		that the alternatively spliced isoforms of the SNCA gene are differentially
		expressed in different parts of the brain for PD and DLB patients. Similarly,
		SNCA isoforms with skipped exons can have a functional impact on the protein
		domains. The large intronic region of the SNCA gene was also shown to harbor
		structural variants that affect transcriptional levels. Here we apply the
		first study of using long read sequencing with targeted capture of both the
		gDNA and cDNA of the SNCA gene in brain tissues of PD, DLB, and control
		samples using the PacBio Sequel system. The targeted full-length cDNA
		(Iso-Seq) data confirmed complex usage of known alternative start sites and
		variable 3{\textquoteright} UTR lengths, as well as novel 5{\textquoteright}
		starts and 3{\textquoteright} ends not previously described. The targeted
		gDNA data allowed phasing of up to 81\% of the ~114kb SNCA region, with the
		longest phased block excedding 54 kb. We demonstrate that long gDNA and cDNA
		reads have the potential to reveal long-range information not previously
		accessible using traditional sequencing methods. This approach has a
		potential impact in studying disease risk genes such as SNCA, providing new
		insights into the genetic etiologies, including perturbations to the
		landscape the gene transcripts, of human complex diseases such as
		synucleinopathies.

		PURPOSE To provide comprehensive diagnostic and candidate analyses in a
		pediatric rare disease cohort through the Genomic Answers for Kids (GA4K)
		program.METHODS Extensive analyses of 960 families with suspected genetic
		disorders including short-read exome (ES) and genome sequencing (srGS);
		PacBio HiFi long-read GS (HiFi-GS); variant calling for small-nucleotide
		(SNV), structural (SV) and repeat variants; and machine-learning variant
		prioritization. Structured phenotypes, prioritized variants and pedigrees are
		stored in PhenoTips database, with data sharing through controlled access
		(dbGAP).RESULTS Diagnostic rates ranged from 11\% for cases with prior
		negative genetic tests to 34.5\% in na{\"\i}ve patients. Incorporating SVs
		from GS added up to 13\% of new diagnoses in previously unsolved cases.
		HiFi-GS yielded increased discovery rate with \&gt;4-fold more rare coding
		SVs than srGS. Variants and genes of unknown significance (VUS/GUS) remain
		the most common finding (58\% of non-diagnostic cases).CONCLUSION
		Computational prioritization is efficient for diagnostic SNVs. Thorough
		identification of non-SNVs remains challenging and is partly mitigated by
		HiFi-GS sequencing. Importantly, community research is supported by sharing
		real-time data to accelerate gene validation, and by providing HiFi variant
		(SNV/SV) resources from \&gt;1,000 human alleles to facilitate implementation

		Currently, protein-coding de novo variants and large copy number variants
		have been identified as important for \~{}30\% of individuals with autism.
		One approach to identify relevant variation in individuals who lack these
		types of events is by utilizing newer genomic technologies. In this study,
		highly accurate PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing was applied to a family with
		autism, treatment-refractory epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and mild
		dysmorphic features (two affected female full siblings, parents, and one
		unaffected sibling) with no known clinical variant. From our long-read
		sequencing data, a de novo missense variant in the KCNC2 gene (encodes Kv3.2
		protein) was identified in both affected children. This variant was phased to
		the paternal chromosome of origin and is likely a germline mosaic. In silico
		assessment of the variant revealed it was in the top 0.05\% of all conserved
		bases in the genome, and was predicted damaging by Polyphen2, MutationTaster,
		and SIFT. It was not present in any controls from public genome databases nor
		in a joint-call set we generated across 49 individuals with publicly
		available PacBio HiFi data. This specific missense mutation (Val473Ala) has
		been shown in both an ortholog and paralog of Kv3.2 to accelerate current
		decay, shift the voltage dependence of activation, and prevent the channel
		from entering a long-lasting open state. Seven additional missense mutations
		have been identified in other individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders
		(p = 1.03 {\texttimes} 10-5). KCNC2 is most highly expressed in the brain; in
		particular, in the thalamus and is enriched in GABAergic neurons. Long-read
		sequencing was useful in discovering the relevant variant in this family with
		autism that had remained a mystery for several years and will potentially
		have great benefits in the clinic once it is widely available.Competing

		Pacific BioScience (PacBio) circular consensus sequencing (CCS) generates
		long (10-25 kb), accurate {\textquotedblleft}HiFi{\textquotedblright} reads
		by combining serial observations of a DNA molecule into a consensus sequence.
		The standard approach to consensus generation uses a hidden Markov model
		(pbccs). Here, we introduce DeepConsensus, which uses a unique
		alignment-based loss to train a gap-aware transformer-encoder (GATE) for
		sequence correction. Compared to pbccs, DeepConsensus reduces read errors in
		the same dataset by 42\%. This increases the yield of PacBio HiFi reads at
		Q20 by 9\%, at Q30 by 27\%, and at Q40 by 90\%. With two SMRT Cells of HG003,
		reads from DeepConsensus improve hifiasm assembly contiguity (NG50 4.9Mb to
		17.2Mb), increase gene completeness (94\% to 97\%), reduce false gene
		duplication rate (1.1\% to 0.5\%), improve assembly base accuracy (Q43 to
		Q45), and also reduce variant calling errors by 24\%.Competing Interest

		Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) benchmarks have been widely used to help validate
		clinical sequencing pipelines and develop new variant calling and sequencing
		methods. Here, we use accurate linked reads and long reads to expand the
		prior benchmarks in 7 samples to include difficult-to-map regions and
		segmental duplications that are not readily accessible to short reads. Our
		new benchmark adds more than 300,000 SNVs, 50,000 indels, and 16 \% new
		exonic variants, many in challenging, clinically relevant genes not
		previously covered (e.g., PMS2). For HG002, we include 92\% of the autosomal
		GRCh38 assembly, while excluding problematic regions for benchmarking small
		variants (e.g., copy number variants and reference errors) that should not
		have been in the previous version, which included 85\% of GRCh38. By
		including difficult-to-map regions, this benchmark identifies eight times
		more false negatives in a short read variant call set relative to our
		previous benchmark.We have demonstrated the utility of this benchmark to
		reliably identify false positives and false negatives across technologies in
		more challenging regions, which enables continued technology and
		bioinformatics development.Competing Interest StatementAMW and WJR are
